Sadly, rmarkdown files is not being rendered on Github. Please refer to the link on Kaggle to see the rendered version of rmarkdown. 
Ie, https://www.kaggle.com/howt51/kaggle-survey-2017-eda-scoring-pay-highchart

Perhaps I would host it on a blog too in the future ( Since Kaggle rmarkdown rendering is also limited).
